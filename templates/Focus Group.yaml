  What You’ll Need:
  1.	A topic or question you want to explore (e.g., "What do students think about the new school lunch menu?")
  2.	A group of people (6-10 participants is a good size).
  3.	A comfortable space to meet (like a classroom, community center, or a cozy room).
  4.	A list of questions you want to ask during the discussion.
  5.	A facilitator (that could be you!) who guides the conversation.
  6.	Something to record ideas—you can use paper and pens or a recording device.
  7.	Snacks or drinks (optional but fun!).

  Steps:

  1.	Pick a Topic

  First, decide what you want to talk about in your focus group. It should be something specific that you want people’s opinions on.

  2.	Invite People

  Invite 6-10 people who can give useful input on your topic. They should have some experience or interest in what you’re discussing.

  3.	Choose a Meeting Place

  Pick a comfortable, quiet place where people can sit and talk easily. You can arrange chairs in a circle or around a table so everyone can see and hear each other.

  4.	Write Your Questions

  Before the focus group, prepare a list of open-ended questions. These are questions that start a conversation instead of being answered with just "yes" or "no." Your questions should encourage people to share their ideas and opinions.

  5.	Find a Facilitator (That Could Be You!)

  The facilitator is the person who leads the focus group. This person asks the questions, keeps the conversation going, and makes sure everyone has a chance to speak. The facilitator is not there to give opinions but to listen and guide the discussion.

  6.	Set Up the Space

  On the day of your focus group, arrange the chairs or tables so that everyone can see each other. Put some paper and pens on the table for people to write down their thoughts, or set up a recording device if you want to record the conversation.

  7.	Welcome the Group

  When everyone arrives, welcome them and explain why they’re here. Let them know what the focus group is about and that everyone’s opinions are important. Tell them it’s a relaxed conversation, and they can share whatever they feel.

  8.	Start the Discussion

  Now, you’re ready to start the conversation! Begin by asking the first question. After each question, let people take turns answering. Make sure everyone has a chance to speak, and if someone is quiet, gently ask them, "What do you think?"
  •	Tip: If the conversation goes off-topic, kindly bring it back.

  9.	Keep the Conversation Flowing
  
  Your job as the facilitator is to keep the conversation going. If there’s a pause or the group is quiet, ask another question or ask someone to explain their idea more. Keep the tone light and make sure everyone feels comfortable.

  10.	Write Down or Record Ideas

  As the discussion goes on, write down key ideas or record the conversation (with everyone’s permission). This way, you can look back at the important points later.

  11.	Wrap Up the Discussion

  After about 45-60 minutes (or when the conversation slows down), thank everyone for participating. You can summarize what you heard.

  12.	 Review and Use the Feedback

  After the focus group is done, take some time to review your notes or recording. Look for common themes or ideas that came up. These will help you understand what people think and how you can improve whatever you're working on.
