  What You’ll Need:
  1.	A Big Room: You need a large, open space where people can move around freely. This could be a hall, a community center, or a large classroom.
  2.	Chairs: Enough chairs for everyone to sit comfortably.
  3.	Paper and Markers: Large pieces of paper and markers to write down topics and ideas.
  4.	Sticky Notes: For people to jot down thoughts or suggestions.
  5.	A Blank Wall or Board: Somewhere to display the topics and discussions that people come up with.
  6.	Participants: A group of people (this can be anywhere from 10 to 100+ people).
  7.	A Timer or Bell: To let people know when it’s time to move to a new discussion.
  8.	A Facilitator (that’s you!): Someone to explain how the activity works and guide the process (don’t worry, it’s simple!).


  Steps:

  1.	Welcome Everyone and Explain the Process

  Start by welcoming everyone to the activity. Tell them they’re here to talk about important topics, and everyone is free to share their ideas and participate in whatever way they like.

  Explain Open Space in simple terms:
  
  - No strict schedule: People can talk about what matters most to them.
  - Choose what you care about: They can join any conversation they find interesting.
  - The Law of Two Feet: If they’re not interested in a conversation, they can leave and join another group.

  2.	Set Up the Space

  Arrange the chairs in a big circle or several smaller circles around the room.
  Find a big wall or board where you can write and display topics that people come up with during the activity.
  Have paper and markers ready for people to use when they want to suggest a topic.

  3.	Create the Agenda Together

  Tell everyone that anyone can suggest a topic they want to talk about. It can be about anything that matters to them and is related to the event’s goal (e.g., improving the community, designing an event, creating a new space).
  Ask participants to write down their topic on a piece of paper (one topic per paper).
  Once they have written their topic, they come up to the board, say their topic out loud, and stick it on the wall. This is how the agenda is created! (It’s completely open—no one controls the list.)

  4.	Start the Discussions

  Once all the topics are on the wall, let participants choose which conversation they want to join.
  Each topic on the wall corresponds to a discussion group. Participants go to the group they are most interested in.

  Facilitator Tip: You can assign different corners or sections of the room for each discussion. For example, the "neighborhood safety" discussion might happen in one corner, and the "playground design" discussion could happen in another.

  5.	The Law of Two Feet

  Remind everyone about the Law of Two Feet: If someone feels they’re not learning or contributing in a group, they can get up and move to another group. This keeps conversations lively and ensures that everyone is engaged.

  6.	Let the Conversations Flow

  There’s no strict time limit for each conversation. Let the discussions continue naturally, but keep an eye on the time.
  After 20-30 minutes (or whenever a conversation naturally wraps up), ring a bell or signal that it’s time to check the board for the next conversation or move to another group.
  People can start new discussions at any time, just by suggesting a new topic and putting it on the wall.

  7.	Capture Ideas

  Make sure each group has a person (or two) who can take notes on the key points from the discussion.
  Participants can write their ideas on sticky notes or a big piece of paper to share with the larger group later.

  8.	Closing the Activity

  After 2-3 rounds of discussions (or however long you have), bring everyone back together.
  Ask the groups to share the key ideas or solutions they came up with. Each group can quickly present their ideas so that everyone knows what was discussed.
  You can write down or display the best ideas somewhere visible, so the group can reflect on them later.

  9.	Wrap-Up

  Thank everyone for their participation! Let them know that their ideas were important, and these conversations will help inform the final decision, design, or event.

  If needed, talk about next steps (e.g., reviewing the ideas, taking them to city officials, or using them to plan the event).


  Bonus Tips:
  - Make It Fun: Keep the mood relaxed and friendly. People are more likely to participate when they feel comfortable.
  - Encourage Movement: Remind people they can move between groups if they feel another conversation is more interesting.
  - No Right or Wrong Ideas: All ideas are welcome, and every contribution matters.
