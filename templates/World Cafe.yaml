  What You’ll Need:
  1. A topic to discuss (e.g., “How can we make our neighborhood better?”)
  2. A space with several small tables and chairs
  3. Paper or tablecloths to write on
  4. Markers or pens for everyone to use
  5. Snacks or drinks (optional, but fun!)
  6. Someone to be the facilitator (you!)


  Steps:

  1.	Pick a Topic

  First, you need to decide what everyone will talk about. This is the main question or topic that you want to explore. It could be about anything important, like how to improve the school playground, create a better city park, or how to make the university more fun for students.

  2.	Choose a Location

  You need a place where people can gather comfortably, like a big room, a hall, or even an outdoor space if the weather is nice. Make sure there are several small tables where people can sit together in groups of 4-5.

  3.	Invite People

  You want to invite a mix of people to your World Café, including friends, neighbors, students, or community members. The idea is to have a variety of opinions and ideas. You’ll need enough people to fill your tables (about 4-5 people per table).

  4.	Set Up the Tables

  Once you’ve got your location, set up several small tables (just like in a café). Each table should have:
  -	Paper or a tablecloth that people can write or draw on.
  - Markers or pens so participants can jot down ideas, doodle, or draw mind maps.
  - Snacks or drinks (optional, but makes it feel more friendly and relaxed).
  Make sure there’s enough room for 4-5 people at each table.

  5.	Decide on a Facilitator

  You (or someone else) will be the facilitator—the person who welcomes everyone, explains how the World Café works, and keeps the conversation flowing. You don’t need to be an expert! Just be friendly and make sure everyone understands what to do.
  
  6.	Explain the Rules

  At the start, welcome everyone and explain how the World Café will work:
  - Everyone will sit at a table with 4-5 other people.
  - They’ll discuss the main topic for a short time (usually about 15-20 minutes).
  - Then, they’ll switch tables to meet new people and talk some more! (Each person brings ideas from their old table to their new table.)
  - This will happen 3 or 4 times (or as many times as you like).

  You should also explain the purpose of the discussion, like, “We’re here to come up with ideas to make our neighborhood better.”

  7.	Start the Conversations

  Now, let the conversations begin! Each table should discuss the main topic for about 15-20 minutes. Encourage everyone to:
  - Write down ideas or doodle on the paper.
  - Listen to each other.
  - Add on to each other’s ideas.

  Remember, there are no wrong answers—the goal is to share lots of ideas.

  8.	Rotate Tables

  After each round (15-20 minutes), tell everyone to switch tables and join a new group. One person should stay behind as the “table host” to share the ideas from the previous round with the new group. The other participants move to different tables to keep the conversation going.
  - Table Host’s Role: Summarize the previous conversation so new people can build on those ideas.
  - Example Rotation: After the first round, you’ll say, “Okay everyone, time to find a new table! One person stays behind to share what was talked about, and the rest move to new tables.”

  9.	Final Round

  After 3-4 rounds of conversation, bring everyone back together in a big group. Now, each table should share the best ideas or insights they’ve heard. You can write these on a big whiteboard or flip chart so everyone can see.

  10.	Reflect and Wrap Up

  At the end, thank everyone for their participation! Go over some of the big ideas and discuss any next steps. You can say something like, “Thank you for sharing your ideas! Now we’ve got some great suggestions for how to make our neighborhood better, and we’ll work on how to put them into action!”

  Bonus Tips:
  - Encourage Creativity: Remind people that they can write, draw, or doodle to share their ideas—it doesn’t have to be only talking.
  - Relaxed Atmosphere: Keep the mood light and fun, like a friendly chat. This isn’t a formal meeting—it’s meant to be creative and relaxed, like a café conversation.
  - Time Management: Make sure each round of conversation doesn’t go on too long—15-20 minutes per round is usually a good amount of time.
